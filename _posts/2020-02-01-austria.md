Our first trip of 2020 was a trip together to Austria. We decided to focus on Salzburg with a stopover in Vienna. We flew into Vienna and then took a train to Salzburg for two nights, then back to Vienna for a night. Salzburg was amazing and was one of our favorite places we've been.

### Where we stayed

Vienna: our first night we stayed at a Holiday Inn in Vienna that was close-ish to the airport, as we were flying in late. It was a very nice Holiday Inn but was not as central as we normally prefer to be. 

Salzburg: We stayed at the Imlauer Pitter in Salzburg. It was a great location and we walked to most everything. The hotel itself was also very nice. 

Vienna: our final night in Vienna we stayed at the Hilton Vienna Park. I love Hilton and we got a nice upgraded view since I have elite status. The hotel was under renovation at the time but was a really nice central location.

### How to get around

Vienna: Since we spent less than 24 hours in Vienna we bought tickets for public transit individually as we needed them. There were machines at the places we needed them, or we used the OBB app. It was a bit confusing to buy individual so next time I think we would buy a 24 hour ticket. We also used the CAT train to get to the airport, which was a bit expensive at €12 each but was nice if you're in a hurry like we were.

Salzburg: We bought the [Salzburg card](https://www.salzburg.info/en/hotels-offers/salzburg-card) and picked it up from the train station on arrival. It had all public transit included and lots of tourist attractions so even for just a few things it was super worth it!

### Things to do - Salzburg

#### Hohensalzburg Fortress 

When we first arrived in Salzburg the man who checked us into our hotel gave us a map and recommended that we see the fortress. The funicular that takes you to the top was closed that day, but he said it was a "nice easy walk". It was a suprisingly beautiful day for January so we decided it was fine to walk up. News flash - it was not an easy walk! But it was very pretty. The view was very nice. The Salzburg card also paid the entrance fee.

#### St. Peter's Abbey

St. Peter's Abbey was very pretty. It's also crazy old so it was cool to walk around. We also ate dinner there at what is believed to be the oldest restaurant in the world! (More on that below.)

#### Untersberg Lift

We did not originally intend to do this because we expected the weather to be pretty crappy in January, and the whole point of going up to the mountain was to see the view. We were very excited to see a beautiful almost 60 degree sunny day and decided to check out the lift. It's about a 30 minute bus ride from downtown Salzburg but the Salzburg card covered the whole thing. We got to the lift at about 10:10 in the morning and found that it only ran on 30 minute intervals so we had to wait for a while. The lift was pretty big though so lots of people could go up at once. The ride up was gorgeous and snowy. The top was even better though!

#### Untersberg Mountain

The view from the top of the mountain was beautiful. There's a little viewing area right out of the lift but you can also walk out of the lift and wander around for a while. Since we hadn't planned on going to the mountain neither of us was dressed to hike so we didn't go very far as it was very icy and slippery. There was a little pub shortly outside the lift though, so we got some Stiegl beers and sat on their terrace in the sun and admired the view for a few hours. It was one of my top 5 travel moments of my whole life! It was so beautiful and so nice in the sun. And the Stiegl didn't hurt ;) 

#### Aldstadt 

The old town in Salzburg is super cute! We had fun wandering around and checking everything out. Definitely worth a nice stroll! 

### Things to do - Vienna

I'm just going to be real here that almost everything to do in Vienna we either were not cultured enough to care about (not really music or art people...sorry!) or the weather was not really nice enough to do. We saw some other stuff like cathedrals but at some point, once you've seen one European cathedral...you've kinda seen them all! 

#### Schönbrunn Palace

This was the summer palace for a royal family in the past. We didn't have a ton of time so we didn't go inside, but the weather was pretty awful so wandering around the grounds didn't last long either. I think this would be really cool to tour on a nicer day though!! 


#### Prater Ferris Wheel 

This wasn't the most exciting thing but we wanted to see the view from the top. It's a huge car with no seats, it goes around once so you can take photos and then you get off. We left the amusement park right after this so I can't say much more about it. It was a bit cloudy but I think the view would have been better on a nicer day! 

### Where to Drink - Salzburg

#### Stiegl

Stiegl is probably one of my new favorite beers ever. If you live in Portland you've probably seen Stiegl at most dive bars - it's that orange and white can of the radler. I tried it once and didn't care for it, so I wasn't that enthused about Stiegl but it's the largest brewery in Austria and super old. I tried their grapefruit radler first on tap and it was SO MUCH BETTER than that version in a can. Then I tried their Goldbrau and I fell. in. love. It was amazing. It is also offered on tap basically everywhere in Salzburg! 

#### Augustiner

This brewery is also super huge and old. As soon as we walked in we were super overwhelmed. There are shelves all around you of mugs, which you grab and then go get in line. You buy a ticket for the number of beers that you want, and then you take your mug up to the counter and give them the ticket and they give you a beer. As far as we can tell there was only one type of beer, but we don't speak German and it was a bit stressful so honestly who knows. Once we got past the stress though it was a super fun place! There were lots of tables so we went and found one. We made some Austrian friends who spoke an okay amount of English and drank beer and people watched. They also have what seemed like little food stands but we had just come from dinner so didn't check them out. 

#### Imlauer Sky Bar

This bar happened to be part of our hotel but I would go back to it even if it wasn't. It had a really beautiful view of the fortress and the mountains and of course Salzburg on tap. The terrace also had heaters and they came around with blankets when the sun went down! They have food too - we ate there for breakfast at the hotel and it was a wonderful spread, but we didn't try the food for dinner.

### What to Eat

Now to the important things!

#### Beer



#### Kuchyn

This restaurant was super neat. Our tour recommended it to us. We had to climb up what felt like roughly a billion stairs to get to it, but it had a lovely view over the city. Instead of a menu, you get a four course meal where the appetizer and soup are a rotating thing. For your main dish, they walk you over to the kitchen and show you all of your meal options and sides in pots and then you choose and they serve it to you! It was very neat and very delicious. 

The appetizers were Prague ham with pickles and creamed horseradish, chicken liver pate, and beets with what I believe they said was cottage cheese but tasted about 1000 times better than any cottage cheese I've ever had.

For dinner Austin chose beef cheek in red wine sauce with bread dumplings and I had pork shoulder in a mushroom sauce with potato pancakes.

Dessert was what they said was sort of like a "Czech cheesecake" - it was really good!

#### Banh Mi Makers

The Czech Republic has a large Vietnamese population because they had an exchange program when both countries were communist. I love Vietnamese food so we had to try to find some good food while we were there. Banh Mi Makers was a very small little place, but I was so excited to see they had Bun Cha on the menu as it was one of my favorite things we ate in Hanoi. It was amazing! Austin said the pho was some of the best he'd ever had. (I was too busy shoveling bun cha into my face to take a photo of his pho.) We would definitely go back next time we are in Prague again.

#### Las Adelitas

Since we've been in Europe we have been _desperate_ for good Mexican food. A Texan living in the Netherlands now recommended Las Adelitas in a Facebook group and I wrote it down for when we went. I am so glad I did because it was phenomenal. I had duck carnitas tacos and they were some of the best tacos I have ever had. We also finished off their whole supply of Sol beer while we were there :)
