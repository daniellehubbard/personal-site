It took us 3 tries and almost 3 years to go to Copenhagen and it was so worth the wait! We had originally booked a trip in September 2019 but we cancelled it because we were moving to Amsterdam. Then we tried again in June 2020 and that got cancelled for obvious reasons. Finally we made it in June 2022! The city is so beautiful and we had so much fun. 

### Day 1

#### Reffen

The first thing we did was take the bus to Reffen, a big outdoor street food market. We had some amazing tacos, a gyro and a duck confit sandwich. The area was super cool too with lots of seating and a fire pit and a bar. Unfortunately most of the food started closing at 9 so we didn't get the chance to try more!

#### Mikkeller

On the way to Reffen we accidentally found this Mikkeller brewery and decided to stop and check it out. It had a cool outdoor seating area and lots of great choices!

#### Ice cream 

On our walk back from the bus we saw a little cafe/store that sold ice cream. We picked out a couple ice cream bars and they ended up being AMAZING.

### Day 2

#### Cub

For coffee in the morning we found this cute little spot called Cub with great lattes and weirdly some of the best croissants we've ever had.

#### Torvehallerne Market

Next we headed to the Torvehallerne market where we tried a few different foods. They had smorrebrød and also some spicy fish meatballs with remoulade. All of it was really good and the market was so cool! We finished off with some delicious plant based ice cream from one of the stands outside.

#### Wandering around

This was our only sunny day so we spent a lot of time wandering around - we went to Nyhavn, the norrebro area and went to lots of little shops, and checked out Christiania, which reminded me a lot of Eugene.

#### Gasoline Grill

After resting our feet for a bit we went and got in line for Gasoline Grill. We got in line just in time as we ended up being one of the last handful of people before they sold out. The burgers were awesome and definitely worth the wait.

### Day 3

#### War Pigs

This place advertised itself as Texas BBQ and honestly it was the best BBQ I have ever had. It's also partnered with a Mikkeller brewery so they had great beer. It was a really cool spot!

#### Rundetaarn (Round tower)

We decided to check out this little tower in the city center. It doesn't cost much to go up it and the view from the top is quite nice.

#### Ramen to Biiru

We ended up at another Mikkeller spot for dinner, Ramen to Biiru. They had a machine to order the ramen just like in Tokyo which was really cool. It was delicious!

#### Park

After dinner we decided to sit outside at a park across the street since the sun happened to come out. It was a really lovely park and nice to sit in the sun for a bit!!

#### Schonnemann

We went to lunch at Schonnemann which is a traditional Danish restaurant. It was amazing! Austin considers the fish to be one of the best meals he's ever had. Everything is smorrebrød, which are like open faced sandwiches on rye. We had fried fish, roast beef and a shrimp salad.

We went to the museum later in the day because it was pouring down rain, but there are no photos of that - it was an alright museum. 

#### DØP

For dinner that night we got hot dogs that we had seen on Somebody Feed Phil. We got all the toppings on it. They were delicious!

Copenhagen was an amazing clean city with lots of amazing food. We would love to go back!!
