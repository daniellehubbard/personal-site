excerpt: Our very first trip in Europe was a trip to Northern Finland to try to see the Northern lights. The trip was amazing but we didn't manage to get a glimpse of the Northern lights. 2024 is supposed to be a year that they are really active, so we decided to try again in Norway.

Our very first trip in Europe was a trip to Northern Finland to try to see the Northern lights. The trip was amazing but we didn't manage to get a glimpse of the Northern lights. 2024 is supposed to be a year that they are really active, so we decided to try again in Norway. After a ton of research we settled on Sommarøy, an island about an hour drive from Tromsø.

We booked a cabin attached to a hotel and spent a lot of time relaxing and just admiring the snow and the beatiful view. 

### Day 1

The journey to Tromso is pretty long. We flew first to Oslo but our flight was delayed out of Amsterdam nearly an hour so we were booked onto another follow up flight To Tromsø. 


#### Burgr 

After an excruciatly long check in process at our hotel, we set out to our favorite restaurant from our last trip, Burgr! It was as delicious as we remembered.

#### Fjellheisen Cable Car

From there we took a taxi to the cable car that takes you up the mountain to a nice view of Tromso. We had a drink and a piece of cake at the top while admiring the lit up city. It was pretty foggy so we couldn't see the beautiful mountains but the lights of Tromsø were quite beautiful.

### Day 2

#### Risø 

On our second day we woke up to go to another repeat favorite, Risø! They have amazing cinnamon rolls and a lovely goat cheese, honey and walnut omelette.

We spent the rest of the day wandering around until it was time for our shuttle to Sommarøy at 4 PM. We were glad our [hotel](https://sommaroy.no/) provided a shuttle service.

After checking into our hotel, we settled in and had dinner at the hotel. 

I got an alert on my phone that the auroraborealis was strong so we turned off all the lights and waited. 

A while later we heard shouting from our neighbors and saw that the lights were out! We rushed out in all of our layers and stayed out for about 30 minutes watching the lights. They were not as strong as you can see on your phone (the activity was pretty weak) but still amazing to see. I still can't believe we got to see it!

### Day 3 + 4 

The rest of the trip was spent crocheting and looking out the window at the scenery, walking around the hotel grounds, going to the sauna and eating at the hotel restaurant (there is nothing else close by and we didn't have a car as we didn't feel comfortable driving in all the snow).

For the rest of this blog post I'm just going to share my favorite photos, as there isn't much to say besides that it was beautiful and I really recommend it :)
