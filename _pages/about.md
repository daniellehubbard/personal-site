Hi! I'm Danielle. I'm a software engineer from Portland, OR currently based in Amsterdam.

I love traveling, baking, eating and watching Parks and Rec with my husband. 

 We moved to Europe to travel more and get outside of our comfort zones. We're having a great time on our new adventure and trying to see as much as we can!
